  <b>Guam</b>
  <br>
  Guam is a U.S. island territory in Micronesia, in the Western Pacific. It's distinguished by tropical beaches, Chamorro villages and ancient latte-stone pillars. Guam’s WWII significance is on view at the War in the Pacific National Historical Park, whose sites include Asan Beach, a former battlefield. The island’s Spanish colonial heritage is evident in Fort Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, atop a bluff in Umatac.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fort Santa Agueda overlooks the coastal capital, Hagåtña, home of Plaza de España's ruins and restored structures, originally built by the Spanish in the 18th-century. The coastline also includes Ritidian Point, part of a wildlife refuge. Tumon Bay is a district with bars, shops and an oceanarium. Clifftop Two Lovers Point is the site of an ancient Chamorro legend. Offshore are dive sites such as Apra Harbor, site of sunken warships. Major pastimes include hiking amid waterfalls in rugged hills and golf.
