  <b>Clearwater Beach</b>
  <br>
  Laid-back Clearwater Beach is known for its namesake stretch of soft, white sand, which draws visitors year-round for jet-skiing, parasailing, and stand-up paddleboarding in its calm waters. Cyclists and rollerbladers glide along a winding beachfront promenade lined with casual seafood restaurants and cafes. Come sunset, Pier 60 hosts a nightly festival with street performers and craft vendors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearwater is a city in Florida's Tampa Bay area known for sunny weather and gulf coast beaches. Clearwater Beach, on a barrier island, is a 3-mile stretch of white sand backed by hotels and restaurants. Injured dolphins and sea turtles are rehabilitated at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. At the city's Spectrum Field, the Phillies pro baseball team plays spring training games.

  <b>Palm Beach</b>
  <br>
  It doesn’t get much better than this five-star, historic, and premium luxury beach resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Guests have been making their vacation dreams come true here since the property opened in 1896. Italianate aficionados might recognize the design, modeled after a Roman Medici palace. 
  <br>
  <br>
  But if you’re here for the beach, you’ll be pleased to know that The Breakers offers guests a half-mile slice of private sand for you to frolick on to your heart’s content. Otherwise, stay wet at the expansive main pool, an infinity-style adults-only pool, a zero-entry active pool (for families), another infinity-style pool near some of the private bungalows, and/or at one of the five whirlpool spas
