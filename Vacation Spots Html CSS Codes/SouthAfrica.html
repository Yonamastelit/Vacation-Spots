  <b>Camps Bay and Beach</b>
  <br>
  No other location in South Africa and perhaps even in the world can boast such a spectacular scenic backdrop to a beach. Camps Bay is a premier vacation destination, offering luxury hotels, serviced apartments and villas - and some great restaurants and sidewalk cafes. The Theater on the Bay and some trendy clubs in the area ensure that entertainment is close at hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is one of the top beach attractions in Cape Town, with a wide palm-lined sandy beach. Lion's Head and the Twelve Apostles, soaring landmarks within the Table Mountain Nature Reserve, dominate the views east, north and south from Camps Bay. To the west, the vista of the Atlantic Ocean draws the visitor onto the soft sand of Camps Bay Beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the summer months, the beach can be packed with locals and visitors, especially over weekends and during holidays. Many visitors enjoy a picnic on the palm-lined lawns. This is a great beach option for everyone – singles, honeymooners and families. The sidewalk cafes and restaurants are just a step away from the beach.

  The city of Cape Town in South Africa is a booming tourist destination for world travelers. The Western Cape is home to coastal, city and inland adventures that suit the backpacker to the high end tourist in search of 5star experiences. The impressive presence of Table Mountain, flanked by the legendary Devil’s Peak and historical Signal Hill, stands proudly above the city. Beautiful white sandy beaches, unique floral kingdoms and magnificent countryside is what the Cape Peninsula is well known for.
